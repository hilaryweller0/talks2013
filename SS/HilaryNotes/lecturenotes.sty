% Package to provide \opttext{text} and \optparagraph{text} commands
% that display the text in red, but if \studentversion is called at
% the start of the document then a gap the same size as the text will
% be left instead. The first is for short expanses of text (e.g. table
% entries) while the second is for paragraphs (including
% equations). Unfortunately it is not possible to have paragraph
% breaks in "text"; you need to call \optparagraph twice.
