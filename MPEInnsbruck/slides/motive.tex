\begin{block}{Why?}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Resolution where it is needed rather than at the poles
\item No abrupt changes in mesh/grid spacing
\item In order to move away from a lat-lon grid, the discretisation and code structure must inevitably be more complicated anyway   
\end{itemize}
\pause
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Why not?}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Lat-lon grid model is simple and $\therefore$ efficient
\item Simple to achieve high accuracy
\item The most accurate forecast models (ECMWF and Met Office) both use lat-lon grids
\end{itemize}
\pause

\end{block}
\begin{block}{But}
\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item Lat-lon grid models do not scale to $\sim\negthinspace 100K$ processing cores
\item Errors associated with local area forecasts
\end{itemize}
