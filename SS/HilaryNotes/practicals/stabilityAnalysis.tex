\subsection{Practical: Stability Analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The magnitude of the amplification factor for FTBS is given by:
\[
|A|^2 = 1 -2c(1-c)(1-\cos k\Delta x).
\]
For a Courant number, $c=0.2$, plot (or sketch) $|A|^2$ as a function of $k\Delta x$. Hence say if long wavelengths or short wavelengths will be damped more. (For the plotting, you could start from the code in \url{pythonExamples/advection/CTCSstabilityAnalysis.py}.)

\optparagraph{Short wavelengths are damped more}

\item Derive an expression for the amplification factor, $A$, for either FTCS or CTBS.
\\ \optparagraph{
\begin{tabular}{ll}
FTCS & $A = 1 - ic\sin k\Delta x$ \\
CTBS & $A^2 + 2cA(1 - \cos k\Delta x + i\sin k\Delta x) - 1 = 0$ \\
     & $\implies A = -c(1 - \cos k\Delta x + i\sin k\Delta x) \pm
       \sqrt{1+c^2(1 - \cos k\Delta x + i\sin k\Delta x)^2}$
\end{tabular}
}
\item Only for FTCS, write down the square of the magnitude of the amplification factor by multiplying $A$ by its complex conjugate ($|A|^2= A A^* = (a+ib)(a-ib)$ for $A=a+ib$).
\\ \optparagraph{
\begin{tabular}{ll}
FTCS & $|A|^2 = 1 + c^2\sin^2 k\Delta x$ \\
\end{tabular}
}

\item Either work out mathematically for what values of $c$ the scheme will be stable or plot $|A|^2$ as a function of $c$ for a fixed value of $k\Delta x$. An example of how to do this with python can be found in \url{pythonExamples/advection/CTCSstabilityAnalysis.py}.
\\ \optparagraph{FTCS and CTBS are both unconditionally unstable (unstable for all time-steps)}

\item For a fixed Courant number of $c=0.2$, plot $|A|^2$ as a function of $k\Delta x$. Will short or long waves be more unstable?
\\ \opttext{Poorly resolved, short wavelengths will be more unstable}
