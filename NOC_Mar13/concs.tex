\heading{Conclusions}

\begin{list0}

\item TRiSK on a hexagonal-icosahedron is very low accurate in theory (sometimes zero) \pauseHS

\item Results of shallow-water test cases are very accurate using TRiSK in comparison to more expensive finite element discretisations\pauseHS

\item Good indications that TRiSK will also be accurate on multi-resolution meshes (avoids need for one-way nesting) \pauseHS

\item Sufficiently smooth multi-resolution meshes can be gerated much more cheaply than have previously been done
