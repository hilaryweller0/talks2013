\frametitle{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item C-grid on a hexagonal-icosahedron is very low accurate in theory (sometimes zeroth order)

\item BUT results of shallow-water tests are accurate and close to 2nd order

\item Computational modes of hexagonal C-grid contolled using CLUST

\item Diamond grid more orthogonal and less skew than cubed sphere

\item New more accurate non-orthogonal C-grid proposed
\begin{itemize}
\item Asymmetric non-orthogonal correction more accurate that symmetric correction despite formal loss of energy conservation
\end{itemize}

\item Sufficiently smooth multi-resolution meshes can be gerated much more cheaply than have previously been done

\item Gradual mesh refinement can lead to improved accuracy

\end{itemize}
