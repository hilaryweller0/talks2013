\subsection{Practical: Alternative Advection Schemes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Some alternative advection schemes are implemented in file \url{pythonExamples/advection/moreAdvectionSchemes.py}. Compare these schemes by un-commenting the lines that call them in \url{pythonExamples/advection/linearAdvect.py}. Try out one of the following changes to one of the existing schemes (they are listed in increasing difficulty so chose one to suit your confidence).

\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
Existing & Modification & Points to consider \\
Scheme   &              & \\
\hline\hline
CTCS &  Clipping of unbounded values & What detrimental effect does this have?\\
\hline
CTCS &  Artificial diffusion to remove & What diffusion coefficient should you \\
  &    spurious oscillations & use?\\
\hline
Semi-Lagrangian & use cubic interpolation & What time-step can you stably use?  \\
with linear  &  & \\
interpolation &&\\
\hline
QUICK & Forward-Backward & Is it now stable? \\
      & time-stepping    & \\
\hline
TVD with van
&\multicolumn{2}{l}{I couldn't find any way to get as good accuracy as CTCS for the smooth}\\
Leer limiter&\multicolumn{2}{l}{bump using a TVD scheme. I tried different limiters, different time-}\\
&\multicolumn{2}{l}{stepping, different schemes for the high order flux. Why could I not}\\
&\multicolumn{2}{l}{find anything as good as CTCS for the smooth profile? Can you?}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\item Compare your results with CTCS and FTBS for the test case that we previously used. In what ways are your results better or worse.
