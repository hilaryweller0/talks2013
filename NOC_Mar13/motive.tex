\heading{Why?\pauseHS}

\begin{itemize}
\item Resolution where it is needed rather than at the poles
\item No abrupt changes in mesh/grid spacing
\item In order to move away from a lat-lon grid, the discretisation and code structure must inevitably be more complicated anyway   
\end{itemize}


\heading{\pauseHS Why not?\pauseHS}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lat-lon grid model is simple and $\therefore$ efficient
\item Simple to achieve high accuracy
\item The most accurate forecast models (ECMWF and Met Office) both use lat-lon grids
\end{itemize}

\heading{\pauseHS But \pauseHS}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lat-lon grid models do not scale to $\sim\negthinspace 100K$ processing cores
\item Errors associated with local area forecasts
\end{itemize}
